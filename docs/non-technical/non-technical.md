## Non-Technical (Pitch Deck & Business Documents)

The non-technical side focuses on *what* the system does, *why* it's valuable, and *who* benefits. This is for stakeholders, investors, and business leaders.

**Core Document: Pitch Deck**

This will be our primary non-technical communication tool. It should tell a compelling story.

**Sections of our Pitch Deck (and supporting documents):**

1.  **Title Slide:**
    *   "The Pulse of the Customer: Real-time CX Platform"
    *   Your Company/Team Name
    *   Tagline: "Measuring and Elevating Customer Happiness, Moment by Moment."

2.  **The Problem (Challenge Three - Core Problem):**
    *   Current State: Digital banks measure CSAT/NPS manually, insights are delayed.
    *   Impact: Missed opportunities, customer churn, damaged brand reputation, slow response to issues.
    *   *Visual:* An unhappy customer icon next to a calendar showing delayed feedback. 
  
3.  **The Big Question:**
    *   "How might we build an intelligent system that captures the voice of the customer and measures satisfaction in real-time, giving the company a live 'pulse' of service quality?"

4.  **Our Solution: The RT-CX Platform:**
    *   Introduce the platform: An intelligent, integrated system for real-time customer experience.
    *   Key Benefits (high-level): Proactive problem solving, enhanced brand loyalty, competitive advantage, data-driven decisions.
    *   *Visual:* A sleek, modern dashboard showcasing real-time data flow. 
  
5.  **How It Works (Simplified):**
    *   **Collect:** In-app micro-surveys, voice-to-text, chatbot logs, passive behavior (anonymized), social media. (Focus on *what* data is collected, not *how* technically.)
    *   **Analyze:** AI-driven sentiment, emotion, and topic analysis.
    *   **Visualize & Act:** Live dashboard with alerts, drill-down capabilities, automated issue routing.
    *   *Visual:* An infographic showing the flow: Data Ingest -> AI Brain -> Dashboard/Action. 

6.  **Key Features & Differentiators:**
    *   **Real-time Micro-Feedback:** Contextual, non-intrusive.
    *   **Advanced AI Sentiment:** Beyond basic positive/negative, detect specific emotions.
    *   **Actionable Insights:** Not just data, but recommended actions and automated alerts.
    *   **Customizable Dashboards:** Tailored for different departmental needs.
    *   **Privacy-by-Design:** Emphasize data security and anonymization.

7.  **Market Opportunity:**
    *   Size of the digital banking market.
    *   Growing importance of CX in financial services.
    *   Competitive landscape (who else is trying to solve this, and how are you better?).

8.  **Team (Optional for initial pitch):**
    *   Brief overview of your team's expertise (e.g., "experienced AI engineers," "CX strategists").

9.  **Call to Action:**

*   **User Stories / Use Cases:** Describe typical scenarios from the perspective of different users (e.g., "As a call center manager, I want to see real-time sentiment for my agents so I can quickly identify training needs").
